## How to build my own image? ##

**Preparation**

- x86 machine running any OS, 4G ram, SSD, quad core (recommended),
- [virtual box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or similar virtualization software, **(highly recommended)**
- host system is **highly recommended** to be [Ubuntu 14.04](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/trusty-updates/main/installer-amd64/current/images/netboot/mini.iso) (**some but not all** sources can also compile on Ubuntu 15.04, Mint 17.2 and Debian Jessie),
- installed basic system, OpenSSH and Samba (optional),
- root access.

**Execution**
	
	apt-get -y install git
	git clone https://github.com/igorpecovnik/lib --depth 1
	cp lib/compile.sh .
	chmod +x compile.sh
	./compile.sh
	
This will download all necessary sources, execute compilation and build an bootable image. Most of things will be cached so next run will be extremly faster!

## How to build my own kernel? ##

**Prerequisition are the same as building an image!**

Edit *compile.sh* prior to running and alter switch:

	KERNEL_ONLY="yes"

In directory (output/debs) you will find deb packed kernel, together with headers, firmware and u-boot.

If you are doing changes to kernel source, disable GIT lock with:

	FORCE_CHECKOUT="no"

If you want to invoke menu configuration:

	KERNEL_CONFIGURE="yes"
